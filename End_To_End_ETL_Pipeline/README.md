# End-To-End ETL Pipeline Projects Using Apache Airflow

This project demonstrates the creation of a fully functional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline automates data extraction from various sources, performs necessary transformations, and loads the transformed data into a target data store.

## Project Structure

- **Extract**: Fetch data from multiple sources such as databases, APIs, or files (CSV, JSON, etc.).
- **Transform**: Cleanse, aggregate, and format data to meet specific business or analytical needs.
- **Load**: Load the transformed data into a target database or data warehouse (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Amazon S3).

## Features

- Modular ETL design
- Automation and scheduling with Apache Airflow
- Scalable for additional data sources and targets

## Prerequisites

- **Python**
- **Apache Airflow**
- **Docker** 
- **PostgreSQL**
